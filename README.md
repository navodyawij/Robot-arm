This repository contains a Ros2 package of an arm model.

1. CAD Model Acquisition
Start with an existing CAD model of a robotic arm designed in SolidWorks.
2. URDF Conversion with sw2urdf
Use the sw2urdf tool to convert the SolidWorks CAD model into a URDF file.
3. Converting URDF for ROS2
Refer to the "https://github.com/xiaoming-sun6/sw2urdf_ros2"to convert the URDF file generated for ROS1 into a format compatible with ROS2.
4. RViz Configuration
Make the necessary adjustments in RViz to visualize and control the robotic arm model in the ROS2 environment.
